# Benchmarking Software Model Checkers on Automotive Code

Contains the benchmarking scripts used for the paper "Benchmarking Software Model Checkers on Automotive Code", to be published in ATVA 2019.

## Structure

`benchmark.sh` is the main benchmark script entry point.

`benchmark_core.sh` contains the core functionality of the benchmarking process.

`benchmark_verifier_output_interpretation.sh` outsources the output interpretation as it is rather lengthy.
